Welcome to the White Whale documentation site.

## What is White Whale?

**White Whale** is a arbitrage protocol devoted to maintaining the peg on Terra stablecoins. T

Deposited stablecoins are represented by [White Whale Terra LP \(Whale\)](protocol/whale-token#whale-token/Whale_token.md/). Whale LP tokens are redeemable for the initial deposit along with accrued interest. White Whale is structured to provide depositors with:

* **High, stable deposit yields** powered by the [Anchor Protocol](https://anchorprotocol.com)
* **Arbitrage Expsure** through [White Whale abitrage](protocol/whale-token/Arbitrage_exposure.md) of stablecoin deposits

White Whale is an open, permissionless arbitrage protocol, meaning that any third-party application is free to connect and earn interest without restrictions. Through [White Whale SDK](developers-sdk/#White Whale-sdk.md), developers can interact with White Whale using just a few lines of code.

Further documentation of White Whale Protocol is provided in the following pages.
