# White Whale Governance

The development and maintenance of the White Whale Protocol is driven by the White Whale community through democratic governance. In the near future White Whale governance will be the sole authority allowed to apply protocol changes or upgrades.

<!-- Following the initial deployment of White Whale smart contracts, the White Whale Gov contract is set as the owner of all White Whale Protocol contracts. Further modifications and improvements to White Whale contracts can only ever be made through the governance poll creation process after the initial deployment. -->
