# White Whale Typescript SDK

The WhiteWhale Typescript SDK allows applications with JavaScript or Typescript runtimes to interact with White Whale Protocol. It supports easy fabrication of messages relevant to Terra-side White Whale smart contracts, used to make contract calls or query contract states.
