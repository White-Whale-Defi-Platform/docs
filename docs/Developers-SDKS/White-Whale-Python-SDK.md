# White Whale Python SDK

The WhiteWhale Python SDK allows applications with Python runtimes to interact with White Whale Protocol. It supports easy fabrication of messages relevant to Terra-side White Whale smart contracts, used to make contract calls or query contract states. It also includes helper classes for development and instantiation of contracts.

> This section only provides a brief overview of the project. For additional information, please refer to the [White Whale Python SDK repository](https://github.com/White-Whale-Defi-Platform/White-Whale-SDK).
